## Overview

- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://quirky-bardeen-10f506.netlify.app/four-card-feature-section-master/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I have learned a new technique which is "transform" in css.

```html
<div class="box box-cyan box-push">
      <h2>Supervisor</h2>
      <p>Monitors activity to identify project roadblocks</p>
      <img src="./images/icon-supervisor.svg" alt="supervisor">
    </div>
```
```css
.box-push {
    transform: translateY(50%);
}
```


### Continued development

I will work closely with using "divs". I realised that using tons of divs will cause issue.

### Useful resources

- [Box-Shadow](box shadow angular material) - This website is very useful for searching that box shadow you wanted.
- [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcSUEo0P0GU) - This is an amazing video which guide me through the project. Helped me to understand my problem and what should I have done.
